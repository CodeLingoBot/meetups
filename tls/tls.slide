* Motivation

- Go 1.6 introduces HTTP/2
- HTTP/2 requires TLS
- TLS requires certificates
- certificates must be signed by authority

* Setup

- domain in control
- GNU/Linux server
- domain pointing to the server

* Code

.code tls/server.go

* Procedure

- checking if we control domain (for each)
- generating certificate
- signing certificate by authority
- configuring server

* Check modes

- standalone
- manual

* Generation
 
 git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
 cd letsencrypt
 ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone -d test.gzapps.com -d www.test.gzapps.com

* Running

 ./tls 443 cert.pem key.pem

* Check

* Non-privlieged user

We should run the program as non-priviliged user but we need to listen on privileged port 443 (and 80).

 setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' tls

* Pros & cons

- enables HTTP/2
- easy
- automatic
- recognized by browsers 
- certificate is valid for 3 months only
- automatic renewal
